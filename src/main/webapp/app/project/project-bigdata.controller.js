The proposed correlation analytics method is to automatically generate multi-variable associated/correlated information for the data in the clinical data repository.",

There is implicit knowledge underlying this big data, but it is not easy or even impossible for human to digest the raw data directly. So how to transform this big data into knowledge automatically shows more and more importance in improving cardiac patient care, research & registry outcomes.',

This project data analysis tries to analyze the CNCDR data in depth to provide knowledge/information to the physician in a friendly way. ',

The user case has been refined with coorperation with clini-cal doctor and BIU, user interface is designed with coorperation with data visualization team, UI design, Philips Netherland, and implementation is coorperated with Pins Philips Netherland and R&D team from BIU.',
            'In physicianâ€™s view, current correlation analytic module is meaningful, and then it has been accepted and transferred to BIU, BIU tries to integrate correlation analytic module into CNCDR platform, meanwhile correlation analytic module will be integrated into DHP. Our next step will focus on patter discovery.'
